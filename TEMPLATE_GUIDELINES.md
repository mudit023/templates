# Template Guidelines
This file will guide you through all the requirements and necessities for creating a template and contributing it to this awesome Opensource project.
## Here are some **MUSTS** for contributing templates to this project

-   **Use of CSS variables** : By using CSS variables you make it easier for the person using your piece of code for creating his *customized* component as he/she can easily change colors and other properties according to the requirements of his/her project.

-   **Properly Commented Code** : It will make users understand how your code works and thus they or you can change it according to the requirements. For more read [this](https://medium.com/swlh/10-reasons-why-you-should-place-comments-in-your-code-96783a69ceda)
- **Creating Independent Components** : This project is solely made so that devs could reuse the individual components to create their projects. Hence, writing such code that does not affect the other parts of the project is necessary. Mainly, the styling should be done in such a way that it does not affect the styling of the whole project and if you suspect any collision please mention by adding proper comments. (Another reason to add comments to your code. )
-   **Every template needs to have a README file.**

### Each Template README should have the following things in it :

-   Screenshots of the component contributed.
-   Proper instructions to use the template.
-   Anything a user needs to know about the template that might affect the user's project.
-   Contributor's name and social media link (GitHub, Twitter).

**Note:**  Every contributor have to follow these guidelines and then only the PR will get merged.
